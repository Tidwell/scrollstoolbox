<h2>How are the prices generated?</h2>
<p>
	Prices are thanks to <a href="http://trading.scrollsguide.com/">Scrolls Trading Bulletin</a> and <a href="http://www.scrollspc.com/">ScrollsPC</a>.  If you choose to use ScrollsPC pricing, you will also be able to select "high," "low," or "median" (average of low and high) pricing.
</p>
<p>
	These prices are updated about every hour, but will not be perfectly in-sync with the respective data sources for a short period of time after the source updates.

<h2>Why do you ask for my In-Game Name and Email on the account page?</h2>
<p>In the future you will be able to reset your account password using your email should you forget it.  Through the ScrollsGuide API will will also be implimenting various features that take advantage of knowing your In Game Name.  Neither field will ever be required, and we will not retain any information if you delete it or solicit you via email.</p>
